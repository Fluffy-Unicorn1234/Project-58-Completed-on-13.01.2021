            <p> My all time favorite hobby is painting! I can paint when it's 12:00 am, I can paint in my sleep, and I can go crazy with my paints! I love painting, as it brings me a sense of calm and peace. Painting always makes me happy, and experimenting with new colors and techniques of painting is always uplifting! Sometimes, I paint with my imagination, and sometimes, I refer to videos or images on YouTube and Google, and then I paint. Whichever way, painting is always fun. Painting can bring out the creative mind and soul out of you, and it can truly make you a calm and peaceful person! </p> <br>
